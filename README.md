Background:

Fires are increasing across landscapes throughout the world due to increased drought, increased temperatures, and human-driven changes (e.g., deforestation). When the weather is extreme, the fires are extreme, often spreading beyond countriesâ€™ abilities to fight them. Fires can move quickly though landscapes and communities, causing immediate damage and extreme health risks due to smoke pollution. 

Often, fires are so big that it is impossible to: (1) see the best paths out; (2) see the best paths available for rescue or fire management vehicles to enter; and (3) estimate where post-fire effects will be the strongest (debris flows, landslides). However, satellite data can see the entire landscape and help with valuable information for those who need it most! 


Solution:

Determination of local fires on the ground with the help of satellite data.
Monitoring and tracking of new fires.
Forecasting the progress of a fire.
Gives users information about the ongoing fire if there is one near the users.
Provides an opportunity to share information about the fire.
